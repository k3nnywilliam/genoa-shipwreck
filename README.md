### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a web-based Lidar scan viewer of the wreck of the City of Genoa in Lake Huron, Detroit. This project was made with CesiumJS and Resium.

"2020 GLOS Underwater Lidar: Lake Huron, MI Point Cloud files with Orthometric Vertical Datum North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) using GEOID18".

### Abstract
Elevations were collected using an underwater laser scanner (lidar) in Lake Huron, MI from November 16 to 18, 2020. Data were geospatially adjusted to match a multibeam survey conducted at the same time. Positional accuracy was not accessed. Data represent the best estimate of the bottom surface.

### Purpose
Utilize remote inspection technologies and laser technologies to collect high resolution point cloud data at potential features of interest as identified in the multi-beam survey.

### Download data via FTP
There are 10 laz files that can be downloaded via ftp url:

### Laz files to point clouds

The original .laz point clouds data were converted to Cesium's 3D tiles via Cesion Ion. Learn more here:
